    "* **Anthropic Claude**\n",

    "## 🛠️ 2. Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Tools are **Python functions** that LangChain agents can use.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "def search_google(query):\n",

    "1. User asks a question\n",
    "2. Search the web\n",
    "3. Summarize results\n",
    "4. Return answer\n",

    "## 🤖 4. Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agents = LLM + Tools + Reasoning**\n",
    "They read the user's question and *decide which tool to use*.\n",

    "Example:\n",
    "If the user asks:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"What's the weather in Bangalore and calculate 2 + 3?\"\n",
